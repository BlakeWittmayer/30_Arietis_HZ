# BinHab

**The official version of BinHab 2.0 can be found at https://physbinhab.uta.edu/**

BinHab.m is a MATLAB adaptation of the work done by [Prof. Dr. Manfred Cuntz.](https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=cuntz)  
The equations and methods used in this program can be found and cited from the following papers (which also have further information):

## Usage

Currently, the application of BinHab.m is limited only to assessing the habitability of P-type stellar binary systems. 
For the purposes of our research, the binary pair 30 Arietis Ba & Bb will be the focus.
