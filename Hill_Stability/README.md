# 30 Arietis Hill Stability
This script calculates the orbital stability of a triple star system using Hill stability. The system is arranged by two close, binary components with a third distant component.  

For the purposes of this research, the values used are for the system 30 Arietis, however this script may be utilized in the future to assess the orbital stability of other 3 body systems.
