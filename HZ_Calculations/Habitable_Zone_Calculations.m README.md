This file plots the stellar habitable zone (HZ) boundaries for 30 Arietis using the expression given from Kopparapu et al. (2014) paper[^1][^2].
This script may be utilized in the future to compare the HZ boundaries of two different stars.

## How to use
Input data is assigned into the `Star` structure array.  
The order of the structure is

* **Star** - Structure array
  * **Designation** - Identifier of the star
    * **Data** - Includes data such as the name of the star, luminosity, and effective temperature
